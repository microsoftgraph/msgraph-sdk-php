# Microsoft Graph SDK Docs

## What is Microsoft Graph?
Microsoft Graph is a unified endpoint for accessing data, intelligence, and insights coming from the Microsoft cloud. You can find more information at [developer.microsoft.com/graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph)

## Why an SDK?
Users can begin developing immediately by connecting with the REST API directly if they desire. If you are interested in diving right in to Graph data, the SDK provides a few shortcuts:

- HTTP logic is written for you so you reduce the amount of boilerplate you need to get started
- The SDK gives you access to PHP objects that you can use to access and update instead of working directly with JSON
- An extra layer of error handling and intelligent defaults helps you debug your application

## Get started
View the [getting started steps](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-php#get-started-with-microsoft-graph) to make your first request with Graph.
