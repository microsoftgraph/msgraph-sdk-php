/**
 * Get recent activities for a given user. This OData function has some default behaviors included to make it operate like a 'most recently used' API. The service will query for the most recent historyItems, and then pull those related activities. Activities will be sorted according to the most recent **lastModified** on the **historyItem**. This means that activities without **historyItems** will not be included in the response. The UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp permission will also apply extra filtering to the response, so that only activities created by your application are returned. This server-side filtering might result in empty pages if the user is particularly active and other applications have created more recent activities. To get your application's activities, use the **nextLink** property to paginate.
