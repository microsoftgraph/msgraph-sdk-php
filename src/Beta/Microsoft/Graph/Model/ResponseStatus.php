This value is used when the status of an attendee/participant is reported to the organizer of a meeting.  notResponded – from attendee's perspective. Indicates the attendee has not responded to the meeting request.  Clients can treat notResponded == none.

Getting Alex' response from the calendar of any other attendee or the organizer's returns none. Getting the organizer's response for the event in anybody's calendar also returns none.
